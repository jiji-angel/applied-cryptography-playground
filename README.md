# Applied Cryptography Playground

This repository contains **practical, Python-based implementations of cryptographic
primitives and protocols**, with a strong emphasis on **correct usage, security pitfalls,
and real-world engineering considerations**.

The goal is not to reimplement cryptography from scratch, but to:
- Demonstrate how cryptographic APIs should (and should not) be used
- Highlight common mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities
- Explain security reasoning behind design and configuration choices

---

## 📌 Scope

The repository covers applied aspects of cryptography commonly encountered in
production systems, including:

- Symmetric encryption (AES modes, authenticated encryption)
- Asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECC usage patterns)
- Hashing and password storage
- Key management concepts and pitfalls
- Randomness and entropy usage
- Secure parameter selection and misuse cases

All examples are written in **Python**, focusing on clarity and correctness.
