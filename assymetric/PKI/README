1. PKI and TLS Certificate Validation
--------------------------------------

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) underpins secure communication on the internet. Incorrect certificate validation can completely undermine TLS.

This section demonstrates:
- Disabling certificate verification 
- Incomplete validation (no hostname check) 
- Proper certificate validation 

Key takeaway:
> TLS is only secure when certificates are fully validated, including trust chain and hostname verification.


2. Signature Verification Misuse
-------------------------------

Correct signature verification requires binding signatures to the intended context (protocol, API, domain). Verifying signatures over partial or transformed data can enable replay or logic flaws.

This example demonstrates the following for EdDSA (Ed25519):
- Missing context binding 
- Verifying incorrect data 
- Proper signature verification
