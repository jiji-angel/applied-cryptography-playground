## PKI and TLS Certificate Validation

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) underpins secure communication on the internet. Incorrect certificate validation can completely undermine TLS.

This section demonstrates:
- Disabling certificate verification 
- Incomplete validation (no hostname check) 
- Proper certificate validation 

Key takeaway:
> TLS is only secure when certificates are fully validated, including trust chain and hostname verification.
