## AES-CBC vs AES-GCM

This example demonstrates the difference between:
- **AES-CBC without authentication** (insecure)
- **AES-GCM (AEAD)** providing confidentiality and integrity

Key takeaway:
> Encryption without authentication is unsafe.

The AES-CBC example is intentionally insecure and exists solely to demonstrate how ciphertext tampering can go undetected.
