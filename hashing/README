## Hashing and Timing Attacks

This folder contains examples related to hashing, message authentication,
and comparison pitfalls that lead to timing side-channel leaks.

The focus is on:
- Naive equality checks that leak information via timing
- Constant-time comparison as a mitigation
- Practical relevance to password checks, MAC verification, and API tokens

These issues remain common in real-world systems despite well-known fixes.
